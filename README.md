## Assessment for React JS and Next JS Developer


This assessment is designed to test an examineeâ€™s knowledge of React JS and its implementations. It is divided into 3 levels, with each feature having to be accomplished consecutively.

Asessment Attachments: You have to deal with Flights API Test collection, you will get it within test repository files, and you can visit Figma link to have preview of the design.

Asessment Duration: Examinee is given 3 days to complete the assessment. On a separate spreadsheet, please log the time spent per functionality (start time and end time). For any questions regarding the exam please send inquiry to m.alhalaki@innovationfactory.biz or HR.

Output: Examinee is expected to send an email with attachment to their output files (preferably a zip file). Alternatively, examinee can attach a link to their GitHub Repository, Google Drive, Dropbox, or any other storage service to download the output if the file is too large to be attached on email, or for other reason.




# Asessment Goals
[ ] Build the system home page, you free to put any fake data in the home page.
[ ] Build login to existing user page.
[ ] Build register for new user page.
[ ] Implement verify feature after login or register to complete the authentication process.
[ ] Build Available flights search Page.
[ ] Build booking flight wizard form page.


# Prerequisites
Use state management
Use store management like Redux
Use caching from client side
Validation and errors handler are required
Clean and tested code
You have to respect the design while you are building the system layout.
You have to implemet client side validation with all forms.
Your component must be reusable, dynamic and able to render something based on the data you've passed.


# Notes
You can replace any data in the design that does not exist in the API by a dummy static data.
You can change some details (height, width, alignment, dimensions,...) for some fields in the design as you see fit, and all of that will be important in the evaluation.
The important point for (Flight Booking page) on Figma is to create cards dynamically according to the number of passengers that you entered in the search page.


Good luck!
